# `do`

**This is a work in progress. There is no actual language here yet.**

`do` is a language with the goal of being extremely limited. By default, it cannot actually do anything at all but be parsed and run. Any functionality it has must be specifically provided. This means that, so long as a sufficiently restrictive API is provided, it is safe to run code other people have written on your server.
